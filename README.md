# MTH-351
A collection of algorithm implementations primarily distributed as part of solutions to MTH 351, Introduction to Numerical Analysis at Oregon State University. All codes are implemented in Matlab and tested with Matlab 2019b.

The majority of these codes are freely availible individually as part of homework solutions for MTH 351 compiled from [here](http://people.oregonstate.edu/~phamt3/Courses/W20-Math-351/W20-Math-351.html), and [here](http://people.oregonstate.edu/~phamt3/Courses/F19-Math-351/F19-Math-351.html).

### This repository is organized into
* Numerical_Integration
    - Riemann Integration methods:
        - Left
        - Right
        - Midpoint
        - Trapeoid
* Polynomial_Approximations
    - Chebychev Points calculator
    - Lagrange's method
    - Newton's method (dynamic programming)
    - Vandermonde matrix method
    - Quadratic Spline
* Rootfinding
    - Bisection Method
    - Newton-Raphson (1 dimension)
	- Secant

Additional codes will be added as generated.
